    "One of the most common tests in statistics is the t-test, used to determine whether the means of two groups are equal to each other. The assumption for the test is that both groups are sampled from normal distributions with equal variances. The null hypothesis is that the two means are equal, and the alternative is that they are not. It is known that under the null hypothesis, we can calculate a t-statistic that will follow a t-distribution with n1 + n2 - 2 degrees of freedom. There is also a widely used modification of the t-test, known as Welch's t-test that adjusts the number of degrees of freedom when the variances are thought not to be equal to each other. Before we can explore the test much further, we need to find an easy way to calculate the t-statistic.\n",

A general method for a situation like this is to use the class and names functions to find where the quantity of interest is.

In this type of plot, the quantiles of two samples are calculated at a variety of points in the range of 0 to 1, and then are plotted against each other. If the two samples came from the same distribution with the same parameters, we'd see a straight line through the origin with a slope of 1; in other words, we're testing to see if various quantiles of the data are identical in the two samples. If the two samples came from similar distributions, but their parameters were different, we'd still see a straight line, but not through the origin. For this reason, it's very common to draw a straight line through the origin with a slope of 1 on plots like this. We can produce a quantile-quantile plot (or QQ plot as they are commonly known), using the qqplot function. To use qqplot, pass it two vectors that contain the samples that you want to compare. When comparing to a theoretical distribution, you can pass a random sample from that distribution. Here's a QQ plot for the simulated t-test data:"

The tails of a distribution are the most difficult part to accurately measure, which is unfortunate, since those are often the values that interest us most, that is, the ones which will provide us with enough evidence to reject a null hypothesis. Because the tails of a distribution are so important, another way to test to see if a distribution of a sample follows some hypothesized distribution is to calculate the quantiles of some tail probabilities (using the quantile function) and compare them to the theoretical probabilities from the distribution (obtained from the function for that distribution whose first letter is \"q\").

Since the degree of freedom correction changes depending on the data, we can't simply perform the simulation and compare it to a different number of degrees of freedom. The other thing that changes when we apply the correction is the p-value that we would use to decide if there's enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis. What is the behaviour of the p-values? While not necessarily immediately obvious, under the null hypothesis, the p-values for any statistical test should form a uniform distribution between 0 and 1; that is, any value in the interval 0 to 1 is just as likely to occur as any other value. For a uniform distribution, the quantile function is just the identity function. A value of .5 is greater than 50% of the data; a value of .95 is greater than 95% of the data.

When we don't specify a standard deviation for rnorm it uses a standard deviation of 1. That means about 68% of the data will fall in the range of -1 to 1. Suppose we have a difference in means equal to just one standard deviation, and we want to calculate the power for detecting that difference. We can follow the same procedure as the coin tossing experiment: specify an alpha level, calculate the rejection region, simulate data under the alternative hypothesis, and see how many times we'd reject the null hypothesis.
